| Feature         | Bitmap Graphics                                                        | Vector Graphics                                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**  | Uses pixels to create an image, where each pixel has a specific color. | Uses mathematical equations to create shapes, lines, and curves. |
| **Scalability** | Loses quality when resized (pixelation occurs).                        | Can be resized infinitely without loss of quality.               |
| **File Size**   | Larger file size due to pixel data storage.                            | Smaller file size as only geometric data is stored.              |
| **Editing**     | Difficult to edit specific elements without affecting the whole image. | Easy to modify individual shapes and elements.                   |
| **Best For**    | Detailed images like photographs.                                      | Logos, icons, and graphics that require scalability.             |

    - Aerial photographs contain intricate details and color variations.
    - Bitmap is ideal for capturing realism.
3. **Background for Mobile and 100x100 Inch Screen** → **Vector Graphics** _(or High-Resolution Bitmap)
    - Vector ensures crisp quality across different screen sizes.
    - If a detailed photographic background is required, a high-resolution bitmap should be used.
