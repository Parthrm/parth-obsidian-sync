#### 1. Define Multimedia. List down the applications of Multimedia.

==**Definition**==
Multimedia refers to the integration of multiple forms of media such as text, graphics, images, audio, video, and animations to present information in an interactive and engaging manner. It enhances communication and user experience by combining different types of content.

==**Applications of Multimedia**==
1. **Education and E-Learning** – Interactive learning materials, online courses, virtual classrooms, and digital textbooks.
2. **Entertainment** – Video games, movies, music streaming, animation, and virtual reality.
3. **Business and Marketing** – Advertising, product presentations, online promotions, and virtual product demos.
4. **Healthcare** – Medical imaging, telemedicine, surgical simulations, and patient education.
5. **Web and Social Media** – Websites, blogs, social networking platforms, and multimedia content sharing.
6. **Engineering and Design** – Computer-aided design (CAD), simulations, and 3D modeling.
7. **E-Governance and Public Services** – Digital kiosks, online portals, and interactive presentations for government services.
8. **Scientific Research and Visualization** – Data visualization, simulations, and virtual experiments.
9. **Virtual and Augmented Reality** – Immersive experiences in gaming, education, and training.
10. **Security and Surveillance** – Video surveillance, biometric authentication, and facial recognition systems.

#### 2. Discuss the stages of multimedia project in detail. 
The Stages of a Multimedia Project
###### 1. Planning and costing
Estimate the time you'll need to do all the elements, and then prepare a budget.
Work up a short prototype or proof-of-concept, a simple, working example to
demonstrate whether or not your idea is feasible.
The ease with which you can create materials with today's production and authoring tools
tempts new developers to immediately move into production—jumping in before
planning. This often results in false starts and wasted time and, in the long run, higher
development cost.
The more time you spend getting a handle on your project by defining its content and
structure in the beginning, the faster you can later build it, and the less reworking and
rearranging will be required midstream.
###### 2. Designing and producing
Perform each of the planned tasks to create a finished product.
During this stage, there may be many feedback cycles with a client until the client is happy.
###### 3. Testing
Test your programs to make sure that they meet the objectives of your project, work
properly on the intended delivery platforms, and meet the needs of your client or end
user.
###### 4. Delivering
Package and deliver the project to the end user. Be prepared to follow up over time with
tweaks, repairs, and upgrades.

#### 3. Difference between vector-drawn objects and bitmaps

| Feature                      | Vector-Drawn Objects                                                                                                                      | Bitmaps                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage Efficiency**       | Requires significantly less memory space compared to bitmaps. Example: A vector rectangle file can be as small as 468 bytes (compressed). | Takes more storage space. Example: A similar rectangle saved as a GIF with a 64-color palette takes 1,100 bytes. |
| **Scalability**              | Easily scalable without loss of resolution or quality. A large image can be resized to a small size without degradation.                  | Scaling results in pixelation (blocky and jagged appearance) or loss of details.                                 |
| **Rendering Speed**          | Loads and renders faster on web pages, especially when using SVG or Flash-based plug-ins.                                                 | Takes longer to load and render, especially in animations.                                                       |
| **Resolution Dependency**    | Resolution-independent – maintains quality regardless of the display resolution.                                                          | Resolution-dependent – quality deteriorates when resized beyond its original dimensions.                         |
| **Best Usage**               | Suitable for web graphics, logos, technical drawings, and animations.                                                                     | Best for detailed photographs, scanned images, and realistic textures.                                           |
| **Conversion Possibilities** | Can be converted into a bitmap when saved as an image file.                                                                               | Converting into vector form is difficult; requires specialized software and techniques like auto-tracing.        |
| **Auto-Tracing**             | Not needed, as vector objects are already defined mathematically.                                                                         | Can be converted into vector objects using auto-tracing in software like Illustrator or Freehand.                |
#### 4. Write a short note on computer color models.
- Models or methodologies used to specify colors in computer terms are RGB, HSB, HSL, CMYK, CIE, and others. 
- Using the 24-bit RGB (red, green, blue) model, you specify a color by setting each amount of red, green, and blue to a value in a range of 256 choices, from 0 to 255. 
- In the HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) and HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) models, you specify hue or color as an angle from 0 to 360 degrees on a color wheel, and saturation, brightness, and lightness as percentages. 
- The CMYK color model is less applicable to multimedia production. It is used primarily in the printing trade where cyan, magenta, yellow, and black are used to print process color separations.
- Other color models include CIE, YIQ, YUV, and YCC.
	- CIE describes color values in terms of frequency, saturation, and illuminance (blue/yellow or red/green, which in turn corresponds to the color receptors in the cones of the eye). CIE more closely resembles how human beings perceive color, but certain devices such as scanners are unable to replicate the process. 
	- YIQ and YUV were developed for broadcast TV (composite NTSC). They are based on luminance and chrominance expressed as the amplitude of a wave and the phase of the wave relative to some reference. 
	- The Photo YCC model has been developed by Kodak to provide a definition that enables consistent representation of digital color images from negatives, slides, and other high-quality input. YCC is used for Photo CD images.
