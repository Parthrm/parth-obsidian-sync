## Creation of Multimedia Images

- Images play a very important role in multimedia products.
- Images can be:
    - Photograph-like bitmaps
    - Vector-based drawings
    - 3D renderings
- The type of still images created depends on:
    - Display resolution
    - Hardware and software capabilities
- Access to the right tools and hardware is crucial (e.g., graphic designers prefer high-resolution monitors).

## Types of Still Images

Still images are generated in two ways:

- **Bitmaps (Raster-based images)**
- **Vector-drawn graphics**

----
## **Bitmaps**
Derived from 'bit' (binary digit) and 'map' (2D matrix representation). Represents images as a matrix of pixels.
### Characteristics:
- Suited for:
    - Photo-realistic images
    - Complex drawings
    - Images requiring fine detail
- Known as **paint graphics**.
- Varying bit and color depths.
### Color Depth:

| Bits per Pixel | Colors Available           |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1-bit          | Monochrome (Black & White) |
| 8-bit          | 256 Colors                 |
| 16-bit         | 32K Colors                 |
| 24-bit         | Millions of Colors         |
| 32-bit         | Trillions of Colors        |
### Bitmap Sources:
- Clip art galleries
- Bitmap software
- Capturing and editing images
- Scanning images

## **Vector-Drawn Images**
Created using geometric objects (lines, rectangles, ovals, polygons) defined mathematically.

### Applications:
- **CAD (Computer-Aided Design) programs**
- **Graphic design for print media**
- **3D animation software**
- **Technical drawings**

### Characteristics:
- Uses **Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z)**.
- Smaller file size compared to bitmaps.
- Easily scalable without losing quality.
- Not suitable for **photo-realistic images**.
- Requires **plug-ins for web display**.

### Comparison: Vector vs. Bitmap

|Feature|Vector Images|Bitmap Images|
|---|---|---|
|Scalability|Excellent (no quality loss)|Poor (pixelation occurs)|
|File Size|Small|Large|
|Best Use|Logos, illustrations, CAD|Photographs, detailed images|

## **3D Drawing and Rendering**

- **3D graphics tools** extend vector graphics into 3D.
- A **3D scene** consists of objects made up of:
    - Blocks, cylinders, spheres, cones.
- **Rendering** generates the final image output.
- 3D modeling techniques:
    - **Extrusion** (extending shape along a path)
    - **Lathing** (rotating a shape around an axis)

## **Colors Models and Palettes in Multimedia**

A color model is a fundamental concept in computer graphics and digital imaging that describes the method by which colors are represented. It is a mathematical model that defines a way to represent colors as a set of numerical values, typically using three or four values. These values, when combined, define a specific color within the color space that the model encompasses. Each color model has its own unique characteristics and is used in different applications based on its strengths and weaknesses.
### Additive Color Model (RGB)
- Used in **TVs, computer monitors**.
- Colors are created by combining **Red, Green, and Blue (RGB)**.

### Subtractive Color Model (CMY/CMYK)

- Used in **printing**.
- Created using **Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black (CMYK)**.

### Color Palettes

- Defines the color of pixels displayed on the screen.
- Common depths:
    - **1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit**.

### Color Models:

|Model|Description|
|---|---|
|RGB|Additive model using Red, Green, and Blue|
|CMYK|Used in printing, subtractive model|
|HSB/HSL|Based on human color perception|
|YUV/YIQ|Used in video processing|

## Image File Types in Multimedia

### Windows Formats:

- **BMP** (Device-Independent Bitmaps)
- **TIFF** (Tagged Image File Format, used for high-quality images)
- **PCX** (Used in MS-DOS paint software)

### Cross-Platform Formats:

- **JPEG** (Best for photographs, uses lossy compression)
- **GIF** (Supports transparency and animations, limited to 256 colors)
- **PNG** (Lossless compression, supports transparency)

### Comparison of Popular Image Formats:
