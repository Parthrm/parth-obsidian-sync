# Digital Audio

- ==**Digital audio:**== is created when you represent the characteristics of a sound wave using numbers, a process referred to as digitizing
- ==**Sampling:**== is recording sound every nth fraction of a second and stored digitally in the form of bits and bytes
- ==**Bit Depth, Sample Size, Resolution, Dynamic Range:**== It is the number of bits used to store each sample of sound.
- ==**Sampling rate or frequency:**== is the number of samples taken in one second. It is measured in kilohertz.
	3 sampling rates used most are:
	- 44.1kHz
	- 22.05kHz
	- 11.025kHz

>[!warning|right-medium]
>- Quantization can produce an unwanted background hissing noise
>- Clipping may severely distort the sound

==**Quantization:**== The rounded off of value of each sample to the nearest integer is called Quantization.

==**Clipping:**== Amplitude greater than the intervals available are clipped off from the top and bottom of the wave.
