### ⚙️ **Rotor Machines**
- **Electromechanical encryption devices** used mainly in the early 20th century.
- Encrypt plaintext by **substituting letters** using **rotating wheels (rotors)**.
- Each rotor performs a **monoalphabetic substitution**, but changes with each keystroke.
- After each key press, the rotor(s) rotate, changing the substitution pattern.
- Provide **polyalphabetic substitution**, increasing encryption strength.
- Famous example: **Enigma machine** used by Germany during **World War II**.
- Include components like:
	- **Keyboard** (for input)
	- **Rotors** (with internal wiring)
	- **Reflector** (bounces signal back through rotors)
	- **Lampboard** (for output)
- Broken by **Allied cryptanalysts**, notably at **Bletchley Park**.
- Key idea: **mechanical movement + electrical paths = complex cipher**.
