A word processor is usually the first software tool computer users learn. From letters, invoices, and storyboards to project content, your word processor may also be your most often used tool, as you design and build a multimedia project. The better your keyboarding or typing skills, the easier and more efficient your multimedia day-to-day life will be. Typically, an office or workgroup will choose a single word processor to share documents in a standard format. And most often, that word processor comes bundled in an office suite that might include spreadsheet, database, e-mail, web browser, and presentation applications. Word processors such as Microsoft Word and WordPerfect are powerful applications that include spell checkers, table formatters, thesauruses, and prebuilt templates for letters, résumés, purchase orders, and other common documents. Many developers have begun to use OpenOffice for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, graphics, databases, and more. It can be downloaded and used completely free of charge for any purpose and is available in many languages. In many word processors, you can embed multimedia elements such as sounds, images, and video.
