3. ✅Explain the 2 basic methods of making colors
	- **Additive Color:** This method creates colors by combining different intensities of colored light sources. The primary colors are Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). When all three are combined at full intensity, they produce white light. This is used in displays like computer monitors (e.g., Microsoft Paint).
	- **Subtractive Color:** This method creates colors by subtracting specific wavelengths of light from white light. The primary colors are Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow (CMY). In printing, black (K) is often added, making it CMYK. This is how physical pigments and inks work (e.g., a printer).
4. ✅Explain the advantages and disadvantages of MIDI over Digital Audio.

| **Feature**       | **MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)**                                                                                   | **Digital Audio**                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nature**        | A protocol/set of instructions describing musical events (note on/off, pitch, velocity, etc.).                                    | A digital representation of actual sound waves (samples of amplitude over time).                         |
| **File Size**     | Extremely small (instructions only).                                                                                              | Much larger (contains actual sound data).                                                                |
| **Sound Source**  | Requires a MIDI-enabled instrument or software synthesizer to generate sound.                                                     | Contains the actual sound; can be played back directly.                                                  |
| **Editability**   | Highly editable: individual notes, tempo, instrument, and other parameters can be easily changed without affecting sound quality. | Editing involves manipulating waveform data, which can sometimes degrade quality with extensive changes. |
| **Flexibility**   | Can easily change instrument sounds after recording; can convert to musical notation.                                             | Records a specific sound; changing the "instrument" requires re-recording or significant processing.     |
| **Quality**       | Playback quality depends on the quality of the MIDI playback device/sound card.                                                   | Consistent playback quality; determined by sampling rate and bit depth during recording.                 |
| **Applicability** | Ideal for electronic music creation, sequencing, and control of musical instruments. Cannot capture natural sounds or vocals.     | Used for recording and playing back any sound (vocals, instruments, environmental sounds, etc.).         |

	- **24-bit RGB Model (Red, Green, Blue):**
	    - Specifies a color by combining red, green, and blue light intensities.
	    - Each color component (R, G, or B) has a value from 0 to 255 (256 choices).
	    - Requires 8 bits of memory per component, totaling 24 bits for a full color.
	    - Allows for 256×256×256=16,777,216 unique colors.
	    - **Web Representation:** Web browsers often represent RGB colors using hexadecimal pairs (e.g., `#RRGGBB`).
	        - Two hexadecimal numbers (0-F) represent the 8 bits for each color component (16×16=256).
	        - Example: `#00FF00` represents pure green (no red, max green, no blue).
	- **HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) and HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) Models:**
	    - **Hue:** Represents the pure color, specified as an angle from 0 to 360 degrees on a color wheel.
	    - **Saturation:** The intensity or purity of the color, expressed as a percentage (100% is pure, 0% is grayscale).
	    - **Brightness/Lightness:** The amount of black or white mixed with the color, as a percentage (100% is white, 0% is black, 50% is pure color for lightness).
	- **CMYK Color Model (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black):**
	    - Primarily used in the printing industry for process color separations.
	    - Less relevant for screen-based multimedia production.

| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Composition**  | Defined by mathematical equations (lines, curves, shapes).                                      | Composed of a grid of individual pixels (picture elements).                                         |
| **Scalability**  | Resolution-independent; can be scaled to any size without losing quality or becoming pixelated. | Resolution-dependent; lose quality and become pixelated when scaled up.                             |
| **File Size**    | Generally smaller, as they store mathematical instructions.                                     | Generally larger, as they store color information for every pixel.                                  |
| **Editability**  | Easily editable; individual objects/paths can be manipulated without affecting others.          | Editing involves manipulating individual pixels, which can be more complex and may degrade quality. |
| **Best Use For** | Logos, illustrations, line art, fonts, and graphics that need to be resized frequently.         | Photographs, complex images with subtle color gradations, and web graphics.                         |
| **Examples**     | .AI, .SVG, .EPS, .PDF (can contain vector elements).                                            | .JPG, .PNG, .GIF, .TIFF, .BMP.                                                                      |
5. What measures should be taken while shooting and editing Videos (x3) 
	**I. Pre-production & Setup:**
	- **Production Environment:** Ensure you have a fast processor, ample RAM, FireWire/USB connection, large/fast hard disks, a second display, external speakers, and Nonlinear Editing (NLE) software.
	- **Storyboarding:** Preplan your video by creating a sequential group of drawings detailing camera angles, lighting, action, special effects, and object movement. This saves time and ensures a clear vision.
	**II. Shooting Techniques:**
	- **Steady Platform:** Always use a tripod or stable surface to avoid shaky footage. If handheld, use image stabilization or wide-angle settings.
	- **Aspect Ratio:** Decide on either 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio _before_ shooting, as conversion methods can cause distortion or loss of image.
	- **Lighting:** Use proper lighting (e.g., floodlight kit, natural daylight, studio lighting setup with fill, key, rim, and background lights) to improve image quality, especially in low light.
	- **Composition:**
	    - Favor close-ups and medium shots for small window playback.
	    - Minimize camera motion (panning, zooming); let the subject provide motion.
	    - Avoid excessive backlighting; compensate or light the foreground.
	    - Be aware of automatic iris adjustments and lock down if possible for consistent exposure.
	    - **White Balance:** Correct white balance to avoid color casts from different light sources.
	- **Chroma Keys:**
	    - Use blue/green screen techniques for special effects or virtual backgrounds.
	    - Ensure even lighting on the screen to prevent choppy keys.
	    - Prevent "color spill" by ensuring subjects are not too close to the screen.
	**III. Editing Considerations:**
	- **Software Choice:** Select NLE software appropriate for your needs, from professional suites (Adobe Premiere, Final Cut) to simpler tools (Windows Live Movie Maker, iMovie).
	- **Generation Loss:** Avoid excessive re-editing and re-saving, as video codecs are lossy, leading to quality degradation with each save.
	- **Storage:** Ensure sufficient disk space to store original footage for EDLs (Edit Decision Lists).

	1. Hypermedia #Definitions 
	2. Multimedia Developers #Definitions 
	3. Integrated multimedia #Definitions
	4. Authoring Tool #Authoring_Systems
	5. Scripting 
9. ✅Explain the concept of dithering in color palettes. 
	Dithering is a technique used in computer graphics to approximate colors that are not available in a limited color palette.
	- **Problem:** When an image created with a wide range of colors (e.g., a 24-bit image with millions of colors) needs to be displayed or saved using a much smaller color palette (e.g., an 8-bit image with only 256 colors), many original colors might not have an exact match.
	- **Solution:** Dithering addresses this by strategically arranging pixels of the available colors from the target palette.
	- **Process:** A mathematical algorithm is applied to each pixel. Instead of simply changing the pixel's color to the single closest available color, dithering alters the color values of **multiple adjacent pixels**.
	- **Effect:** By mixing these limited colors in a specific pattern, the human eye perceives an optical illusion of a new color that is not actually present in the palette. This creates a visually smoother transition and a better replication of the original image, even with fewer colors.
