### ğŸ”¹ **Definition:**
**Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)** is a block cipher mode of operation where each plaintext block is **XORed with the previous ciphertext block** before encryption, ensuring that **identical plaintext blocks result in different ciphertexts** if the preceding blocks differ.

### ğŸ”¹ **Example:**
Assume a message `"HELLOWORLD"` is split into two blocks:
- P1 = "HELLO"
- P2 = "WORLD"
Assume:
- IV = `00000` (Initialization Vector)
- Key = `K`
- Encryption function = `E(K, X)`, XOR denoted by âŠ•
Encryption:
- C1 = E(K, P1 âŠ• IV)
- C2 = E(K, P2 âŠ• C1)
So even if P1 = P2, **C1 â‰  C2**, thanks to chaining via C1.

### ğŸ”¹ **Explanation:**
CBC overcomes ECBâ€™s flaw where identical plaintext blocks yield identical ciphertexts. It introduces **randomness** through:
1. **Initialization Vector (IV):** XORed with the first block of plaintext.
2. **Chaining:** Each ciphertext block influences the encryption of the next block.
**Decryption works as:**
- P1 = D(K, C1) âŠ• IV
- Pj = D(K, Cj) âŠ• Cjâˆ’1 for j > 1
Thus, both sender and receiver must share the IV securely.

### ğŸ”¹ **Formulas:**
- **Encryption:**
    - C1=EK(P1âŠ•IV)
    - Cj=EK(PjâŠ•Cjâˆ’1)
	for j=2,â€¦,N
- **Decryption:**
    - P1=DK(C1)âŠ•IV
    - Pj=DK(Cj)âŠ•Cjâˆ’1â€‹ 
    for j=2,â€¦,N
Where:
- EKE_KEKâ€‹: Encryption with key KKK
- DKD_KDKâ€‹: Decryption with key KKK
- âŠ•: Bitwise XOR

### ğŸ”¹ **Advantages:**
- ğŸ”¹ Conceals plaintext patterns (unlike ECB).
- ğŸ”¹ Provides semantic security under chosen-plaintext attacks.
- ğŸ”¹ Allows use for both **confidentiality** and **authentication** (with MAC).

### ğŸ”¹ **Disadvantages:**
- ğŸ”» **Cannot parallelize encryption** (due to chaining).
- ğŸ”» **Error propagation:** one bit error in a ciphertext block affects two plaintext blocks.
- ğŸ”» Requires **secure handling of IV**:
    - Must be unique and unpredictable.
    - Must be known to both sender and receiver.

### ğŸ”¹ **Works Best For:**
- âœ… Encrypting **long messages** or files where security against pattern leakage is important.
- âœ… Secure transmission of structured or repeated plaintext blocks.

### ğŸ”¹ **Does Not Work When:**
- ğŸš« The IV is reused or predictable.
- ğŸš« High performance parallel encryption is needed.
- ğŸš« The system cannot securely distribute or protect the IV.
