### 🔹 **Definition:**
**Electronic Code Book (ECB)** is the simplest block cipher mode of operation where each block of plaintext is encrypted independently using the same key, resulting in identical ciphertext blocks for identical plaintext blocks.
 
### 🔹 **Example:**
Let’s say we are encrypting the message:  
`"HELLOHELLO"` using a block cipher with block size = 5 characters.
Plaintext blocks:
- P1 = "HELLO"
- P2 = "HELLO"
After applying ECB with a given key `K`, the ciphertext might be:
- C1 = `8X7GF`
- C2 = `8X7GF`
  
> Because both plaintext blocks are the same, the ciphertext blocks are identical too.

### 🔹 **Explanation:**
ECB mode processes **each block of plaintext independently**:
- **No chaining** or dependency between blocks.
- Suitable for short or random data (like encrypting a single block key or password).
But:
- **Patterns in data** can **leak through encryption**, making ECB insecure for long or structured plaintext.
 
### 🔹 **Formulas:**
- **Encryption:**  
    Cj=EK(Pj)C_j = E_K(P_j)  
    for j=1j = 1 to NN
- **Decryption:**  
    Pj=DK(Cj)P_j = D_K(C_j)  
    for j=1j = 1 to NN
Where:
- PjP_j: j-th plaintext block
- CjC_j: j-th ciphertext block
- EKE_K: encryption with key KK
- DKD_K: decryption with key KK

### 🔹 **Advantages:**
- 🔹 Very simple to implement.
- 🔹 Supports **parallel encryption/decryption**.
- 🔹 No need for an initialization vector (IV).
- 🔹 Low overhead in terms of computation and memory.
 
### 🔹 **Disadvantages:**
- 🔻 Identical plaintext blocks → identical ciphertext blocks.
- 🔻 Leaks patterns and structure of plaintext.
- 🔻 Vulnerable to block rearrangement and substitution attacks.
- 🔻 Not secure for structured or long messages.
 
### 🔹 **Works Best For:**
- 🔐 Encrypting small, random, or unique blocks (e.g., encryption keys, passwords).
- ✅ Situations where data is **shorter than one block** (e.g., < 128 bits for AES).

### 🔹 **Does Not Work When:**
- 🚫 Encrypting structured, repeated, or long messages (e.g., text files, images).
- 🚫 When high confidentiality is required.
- 🚫 In contexts where attackers can guess or know part of the plaintext.
